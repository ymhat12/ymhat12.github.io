# About Me 

I am Yash Mhatre, a final year student studying a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (Honours) majoring in Electrical and Electronics at the
University of Queensland. This Blog is reflective of my time studying ELEC4630 Computer Vision & Deep Learning taught by Professor 
Brian Lovell. 

My exposure to AI prior to this subject was somewhat limited as such this blog post is implemented to track my progress and express all the 
topics and problems I have experienced during my time undertaking this course. 

Hope you enjoy the blog! :)
